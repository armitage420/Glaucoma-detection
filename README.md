# Glaucoma-detection

# >> "2019-Automatic glaucoma classification using color fundus images based on convolutional neural networks and transfer learning" research paper added for reference.

# >> DRISHTI dataset downloaded from https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/mip/drishti-gs/mip-dataset2/Home.php
# > Only fundus images were required for this research paper.
# > The images that were already divided into test and training dataset, now divided into folders of Glaucomatous and normal in each test and train folders.
